            <TextBlock Text="The player to the left of the dealer looks directly at any opponent and says, for example, Give me your kings, usually addressing the opponent by name and specifying the rank that they want, from ace down to two. The player who is fishing must have at least one card of the rank that was asked 
                       for in their hand. The player who is addressed must hand over all the cards requested. If the player has none, they say, Go fish! and the player
                       who made the request draws the top card of the stock and places it in their hand.

                        If a player gets one or more cards of the named rank that was asked for, they are entitled to ask the same or another player for a card. The player 
                       can ask for the same 
                       card or a different one. So long as the player succeeds in getting cards (makes a catch), their turn continues. When a player makes a catch, they must 
                       reveal the card so that the catch is verified. If a player gets the fourth card of a book, the player shows all four cards, places them on the table face up in front of everyone, and plays again.

                       If the player goes fishing without making a catch (does not receive a card he asked for), the turn passes to the left.

                       The game ends when all thirteen books have been won. The winner is the player with the most books. During the game, if a player is left without cards, 
                       they may (when it's their turn to play), draw from the stock and then ask for cards of that rank. If there are no cards left in the stock, they are
                       out of the game." Width="995" Height="416" HorizontalAlignment="Center" SelectionChanged="TextBlock_SelectionChanged"/>
